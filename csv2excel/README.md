Sure, let's break down the code line by line:

```python
import openpyxl
import sys
```
- This part of the code imports the `openpyxl` module, which is used for working with Excel files, and the `sys` module, which provides access to some variables used or maintained by the Python interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter. 

```python
csv_name = input("Name of the input CSV file with extension: ")
sep = input("Separator of the CSV file: ")
ename = input("Name of the output excel file with extension: ")
sname = input("Name of the output excel sheet: ")
```
- These lines prompt the user to input various details: the name of the input CSV file (`csv_name`), the separator used in the CSV file (`sep`), the name of the output Excel file (`ename`), and the name of the output Excel sheet (`sname`). The `input()` function is used to accept user input from the command line.

```python
try:
    workbook = openpyxl.load_workbook(ename)
    sheet = workbook.get_sheet_by_name(sname)
    file = open(csv_name, "r", encoding="utf-8")
except:
    print("Error: File not found")
    sys.exit()
```
- This code segment tries to open the output Excel file specified by `ename` using `openpyxl.load_workbook()` and gets the specified sheet using `workbook.get_sheet_by_name()`. It also tries to open the input CSV file specified by `csv_name` using the `open()` function. If any of these operations fail (e.g., file not found), it prints an error message and exits the program using `sys.exit()`.

```python
excel_row = 1
excel_column = 1
```
- These lines initialize variables `excel_row` and `excel_column` to 1. These variables are used to track the current row and column in the Excel sheet where data will be written.

```python
for lines in file:
    lines = lines[:-1]
    lines = lines.split(sep)
```
- This loop iterates over each line in the input CSV file (`file`). Each line is stripped of its newline character (`lines[:-1]`) and then split into a list of values using the specified separator (`sep`). 

```python
    for dat in lines:
        sheet.cell(excel_row, excel_column).value = dat
        excel_column += 1
```
- This inner loop iterates over each value (`dat`) in the list of values obtained from splitting the CSV line. It assigns each value to the corresponding cell in the Excel sheet (`sheet.cell(excel_row, excel_column).value = dat`) and then increments the `excel_column` variable to move to the next column.

```python
    excel_column = 1
    excel_row += 1
```
- After finishing writing all values from a CSV line to the Excel sheet, the `excel_column` variable is reset to 1, and `excel_row` is incremented to move to the next row in the Excel sheet.

```python
workbook.save(ename)
file.close()
```
- After writing all data from the CSV file to the Excel sheet, the Excel workbook is saved using `workbook.save(ename)`, and the input CSV file is closed using `file.close()`.

The second part of the code is essentially a repetition of the first part, prompting the user again for input and performing the same operations to read data from a CSV file and write it to an Excel sheet.
